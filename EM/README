Homework: Implement EM fitting of a mixture of gaussians on the two-dimensional data set points.dat. You should try different numbers of mixtures, as well as tied vs. separate covariance matrices for each gaussian.

************ Results *******

Plot of the likelihood

************ Your interpretation **** 

Your understanding of the results, for instance, "from the above results, learning rate is very important that a learning rate from XX to XX yields the best result, and that a learning rate larger than XX yields a significant drop of the performance"

When the capacity C is rather small, the weights will be small and unlikely overfitting. But the error are almost ignored. With C rising, the model will focus on the errors gradually. However, it will tends to overfit when C is too large. So the accuracy will rise and then fall.
