Homework: Implement EM to train an HMM for whichever dataset you used for assignment 7. The observation probs should be as in assignment 7: either gaussian, or two discrete distributions conditionally independent given the hidden state.Does the HMM model the data better than the original non-sequence model? What is the best number of states? (The answer is in the interpretation section)

Plot of the likelihood with train and dev data

************ Your interpretation **** 

I think this model is better than the non-sequential one because from the plot of state 2 and 3 we can find that there is a sequential relation in the data due to the stable likelihood the model achieve in the last. And states of 2 may be the best setting for the model because it is stable in the last (contrast with 4 or more states) and the likelihood is larger than states of 3.
