Zhang_Wei_hw3.py: main algorithm file
plot.py: the file to experiment with capacity C and plot the result
plot.png the result figure of plot.py

************ Algorithm *****
Firstly, I use function 'dataloader' to load the datasets into a 2D arrays(trainset,testset and devset

Then, for each transaction in data set, make dot production with x and weight and multiply the result with class label y.
If the result is less than 1
then, update the weight vector according to the formula w = w- 1/N*w + η*C*y*x(where η is the learning rate) and the bias b = b+ η*C*y
else, update the weight vector as w = w- 1/N*w

For testing, I only do the do production mentioned above as the prediction result as the bias is actually concatenated with the weight vector.


************ Instructions ***

To test with fixed epochs and capacity C:
./Zhang_Wei_hw3.py --epochs [int] --capacity [float]
To experiment on C and plot the result:
./plot.py
./Zhang_Wei_hw3.py 


************ Results *******

With the increasing of the C, the performance improves rapidly at the beginning but falls then.
Finally, it bumps up immediately and then falls again. 

************ Your interpretation **** 

Your understanding of the results, for instance, "from the above results, learning rate is very important that a learning rate from XX to XX yields the best result, and that a learning rate larger than XX yields a significant drop of the performance"

When the capacity C is rather small, the weights will be small and unlikely overfitting. But the error are almost ignored. With C rising, the model will focus on the errors gradually. However, it will tends to overfit when C is too large. So the accuracy will rise and then fall.
